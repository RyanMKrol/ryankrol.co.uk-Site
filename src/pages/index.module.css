/* Annoyingly, the height of the inner container keeps it's original
height before the scale is applied. This means we have to manually
force the height of the container back down to restore the layout.
The values here are calculated by taking the difference between the
height of each .innerDataContainer, and .dataContainer class, and then
adding 10 to make sure the drop shadow doesn't clip. I have to do this
for each different card container, because some cards are bigger/smaller
than others, and require different margins */
