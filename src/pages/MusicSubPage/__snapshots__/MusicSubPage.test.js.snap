    I spend a lot of time cultivating my interest in music, finding new artists, and expanding my tastes. You can find my account on
    <a
      href="https://www.last.fm/user/somethingmeaty"
    >
      <span
        className="highlighted"
      >
         LastFM 
      </span>
    </a>
    where I'm always tracking what I'm listening to. The albums below show the albums that I've listened to the most over the last year (don't judge!).

    Note: Sadly I'm no longer able to track this data as I've moved to Apple Music, which doesn't appear to support tracking data via LastFM. I still quite like the data I've amassed over the past couple of years though, so I'll keep this section for now.
