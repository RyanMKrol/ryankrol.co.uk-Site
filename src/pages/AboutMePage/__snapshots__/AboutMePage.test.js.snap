    Welcome to my website!
  </h1>
  <p>
    I'm a London-based software engineer, currently working at Amazon UK building and maintaining acquisition experiences for PrimeVideo. If you have ever paid for a film/tv show that was streamed on Amazon, the chances are you've used my code!
  </p>
  <p>
    In my spare time, I like to hack together side projects just like this website, and many others that will no doubt be detailed somewhere on this site.

    I've recently been enjoying keeping track of the films and albums I've been enjoying, so if you care about my opinion on anything, you can find what I think of those here too :D
